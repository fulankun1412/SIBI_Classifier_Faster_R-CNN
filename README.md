# SIBI_Classifier_Faster_R-CNN
Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia Classifier Using Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network
This is a system or application that capable do object detection and classification on Indonesian Sign Language namely Sistem Isyarat Bahasa Indonesia using Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network.
This classification right now can only classify 26 class of 26 Alphabets in Bahasa Indoneisa Language but can be further develop into more complexes class if more dataset acquired.
The dataset for training and testing are about 520 photos of image of hand with pre-determined condition where hand gesture captured on white background.

## Minimal Pre-requisite
1. Tensorflow 1.15 or 2.3
2. Open-CV Python
3. Python 3.7.5

If you have CUDA capable GPU, maybe you want to use for fast inference in Object detection and Classification in this program.
